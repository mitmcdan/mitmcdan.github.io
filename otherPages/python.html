    <h4>Python Practice</h4>
    <p>For my classes at IU we have been taking several classes all done in Python. As such we have taken several practicals and small projects to practice and learn Python. </p>
    <p>These are examples of my code from the lab praticals, all of which averaged a perfect grade. 
        I am not sure if that means the tests were easy or its good code, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but here are the files so you can see for your self:</p>
    <p> ** This code is not to be used for anything except for past reflection and learning, please don't try to cheat with this! ** </p>
