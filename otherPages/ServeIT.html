    <h5>ServeIT Work Experience</h5>
    <p>Last fall I applied and was accepted into a program created for and by developers to help nonprofits while teaching students to code. 
    Serve IT is one of the best work expierence of my career, you are assigned to a team of 5 developers to work together to build a product 
    that a local non-profit needs (all unpaid of course). The team I was place into was MCSWCD, which is the Monroe County Soil
    and Water Conservation District (I know, I know, not the best acronym). I was assigned as the front-end developer and designer for my team 
    thus was in charge of design the site and developing the UX/UI and all other pieces that the user would interact with. We had been 
    asked to create a solution for a way to have local farmers connect their produce to local residents; the end game was to help
    increase local economic growth and increase reveanue for the farmers as larger companies (Walmart and Kroger) have been taking
    over the sales for Organic produce. Our solution was to build a web application that allowed us to create profiles for every farmer
    with a list of their farmstand locations with what produce they sell; then users could search for any type of locally grown products
    and get a result they could follow all in an application. We quickly built wireframes and mockups and met often with our client 
    to ensure that our solution was backed and going to have an impact, we then spent time on branding and came up with the name Mark-it
    (supposed to be a clever blend of 'market' and 'mark it on a map'). Once that foundation was laid we quickly built out a MVP and 
    shipped it out for testing.
